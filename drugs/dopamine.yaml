class: Inotrope
chemistry: Endogenous catecholamine
dose:
    shock: 1-50µg/kg/min. ↑ By 1-4µg/kg/min ~10 minutely until desired response.
pharmaceutics:
    presentation: Clear, colourless solution with 200mg or 800mg in water
pharmacokinetics:

        protein binding:
    metabolism:
        half-life: 3 minutes
        pathway:
            - 25% of dose converted to noradrenaline
            - Remainder is metabolised by MAO and COMT similar to nor/adrenaline

        renal: Metabolites
mechanism: D1 dominates at ≤5µg/kg/min. β1 dominate at 2-10µg/kg/min. α dominates >10µg/kg/min.
