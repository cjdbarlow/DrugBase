class: Vasopressor
chemistry: Endogenous catecholamine
dose:
    shock: 0.05-1.5µg/kg/min
pharmaceutics:
    presentation: Clear, colourless, light-sensitive solution. Sodium metabisulfite as excipient.
pharmacokinetics:
    absorption: No PO bioavailability due to destruction by COMT and MAO in the gut brush border

        protein binding: 25%
    metabolism:
        half-life: 2 minutes
        pathway: Metabolised rapidly and completely by mitochondrial MAO and COMT within liver, kidney, and blood
        metabolites:
            - VMA
            - Normetadrenaline
    elimination:
        renal: Metabolites
        other: Pulmonary uptake of up to 25%
mechanism: Highly selective for the α1 adrenoreceptor.
pharmacodynamics:
    resp:
        - ↑ Minute ventilation
        - Bronchodilation
    cvs: 
        - ↑ SVR
        - Venoconstriction and ↑ preload
        - ↑ Myocardial oxygen consumption
        - ↑ Coronary flow
        - Reflex ↓ HR secondary to ↑ SVR
